[00:10.00] The cold wind pierces through my heart
[00:13.20] The blurry streetlights hide my tears
[00:16.85] The moment I knew what loneliness was
[00:20.40] I felt like I found a piece of the future
[00:24.15] Beyond the locked door
[00:27.65] I hear a whispering dream
[00:31.30] I want to believe, but I'm so afraid
[00:34.90] Reaching out with trembling hands
[00:38.55] Under the stardust night, I make a wish
[00:42.10] That your smile will never fade away
[00:45.75] Holding onto strength within the fleeting moments
[00:49.25] I will keep chasing the light, again and again
[00:52.00] Guided by the signpost soaked in rain
[00:55.30] I trace back the memories from afar
[00:58.90] The unseen future makes me anxious
[01:02.50] But a small flame flickers deep in my heart
[01:06.25] There's no dream that’s out of reach
[01:09.75] Because you were the one who showed me
[01:13.40] I won’t forget, no matter when
[01:16.95] Your voice will always lead me
